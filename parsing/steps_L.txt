parsing steps cuz im lost:
##########################

- initialize

- get the environment set up 
	- increase SHLVL

- signals

- readline for input

- history???

- check if theres open quotes
- check if theres any syntax errors in the beginning or end
- split pipes and check if theres like >|< or smth idk (maybe check that later)
- expand env variables (eg; $USER) if double quotes
- replace \ characters (eg; \n , \t , ...)
- handle $?
- preserve quotes
- 

= things that should fail
	- echo m'y frie"nd
	- echo hello > > file 
	- '|'   ,   ">"    and those stuff (actually just operators alone)
= this should pass for parsing
	- echo hello | meow world

- exit with codes, look up what they should be






notes
- bash ececutes from the end to the start (world hello)
- pipe changes fd from output to input
-
