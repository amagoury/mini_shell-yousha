what to do :
------------

lyall:
- parse the input
- separate into command, argument operators, etc. and add to struct 
- make sure the parsing is working with the builtins




aisha:
- start to get the builtin functions and make sure its working with the parsing
-handel signels
-readlines and function hestory
- i dont know what the fuck is dup2 but  we need to deal with it 





what I got  for the to do list

//Mandatory Features
Basic Shell Functions
 1- Prompt:
Display a prompt waiting for a new command.


2-History:
Implement command history functionality.


3- Command Execution:
Search and execute commands using $PATH, relative, or absolute paths.
Quotes and Redirections

4- Single & Double Quotes:
Handle ' (single quotes) to prevent interpreting metacharacters.
Handle " (double quotes), interpreting $ inside them.

5- Redirections:
< Input redirection.
> Output redirection.
<< Here-document functionality.
>> Append redirection.

6- Pipes
Implement Piping:
Connect command outputs to the inputs of subsequent commands using |.

7- Environment Variables
Variable Expansion:
Expand $ followed by a sequence of characters.
Expand $? to the exit status of the last foreground pipeline.

8- Signal Handling
Handle signals:
Ctrl+C creates a new prompt.
Ctrl+D exits the shell.
Ctrl+\ does nothing.

9- Built-in Commands
Implement built-ins:
echo (with -n option).
cd (relative/absolute path only).
pwd (print working directory).
export (no options).
unset (no options).
env (no options/arguments).
exit (no options).

10- Memory Management
Free memory:
Ensure no leaks in your code.
You don't need to fix memory leaks in readline().
